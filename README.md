## Installation
1. Upload `yeti-cms.zip` to your server.
2. Extract the archive (`unzip yeti-cms.zip`)
3. Ensure the directory is located at the root of your public directory (so that Yeti CMS is located at `http://yourdomain.com/`).
4. Ensure this directory is writable. `chmod -R 777 .` should do the trick.
5. Navigate to Yeti CMS (it should be `http://yourdomain.com/`).
6. Follow the instructions. You will be required to choose a password and sign up for UploadCare (Image Management).

Once completed, you will be able to log into the CMS @ `http://yourdomain.com/yeti-admin/`. You can drag and drop files to upload, and perform basic file management tasks. You can even drag-and-drop an entire `.zip` archive, which will be decompressed automatically.
